## Notes

 The store orchestrates all the moving parts in Redux<br>
 The Redux store is fundamental: the state of the whole application lives inside the store.
<br>
 Redux the state must return entirely from reducers.<br>
 A reducer is just a JavaScript function. A reducer takes two parameters: the current state and an action.<br>
 Reducers produce the state of the application.

 the Redux store is like a brain: itâ€™s in charge for orchestrating all the moving parts in Redux<br>
the state of the application lives as a single, immutable object within the store<br>
as soon as the store receives an action it triggers a reducer<br>
the reducer returns the next state
